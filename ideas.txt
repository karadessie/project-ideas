                                       Project Ideas

1. Personal Medical App

   Database of test results and personal medical information, including home blood glucose results, blood pressure, 
   heart rate, weight, etc. Users can enter personal results and stats and also link to their patient portal(s). They can
   keep and update a list of their healthcare professionals, including specialty and contact information. Additionally, 
   users can save and update their insurance information and a list of current medications.

2. Rate My Hair Stylist

   Similar to Rate My Professor, users can search for a hair stylist by city and hair salon. Stylists by hair salon
   and location will be added and stored in a databse. Users can search for a stylist and view their reviews or add a
   review. If the stylist is not found they can add them to a salon. If the salon is not found they can add the salon
   and then the stylist before adding their review.

3. Home cooking App: grocery inventory, shopping lists, recipes with nutrition facts, daily nutrition goals
4. Virtual Scrapbook: save pictures, certificates, diplomas, dates, names, family history, make printable pages, add design or d√©cor
5. Global Climate Change App

   Users can access a home app where they can link to their utility account and track expenses and trends, upload shopping
   receipts and expenses, set energy usage and budget goals, and track their progress. They can also access a community
   app using their library card, where they can view eco-friendly community boards and submit posts or suggestions. 
   Additionally, users can sign in and view state, national, and global apps displaying daily CO2 emissions, particulate 
   counts and climnate change news stories. Administrative functions, including instant messaging and conferencing between
   stakeholders with administrator priveleges, are included in the application.
